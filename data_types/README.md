Lucas, CEO of Digital Natives found a Google Docs, containing all previous subcontractors and their contact details in a bulk format. The docs contains a csv string, in the following format:

full_name,gender,birth_date,phone_number,email_address,first_project_date,tech_stacks

An example row looks like the following:

Nick Nate Nice,male,2013.11.09.,+36303218129,nick.nice@gmail.com,2000.04.04.,Ruby|Javascript|PHP

Details:

full_name: can contain 2 or 3 words: last_name middle_name first_name. Middle name is optional,
gender: can be either male, female or other,
birth_date: format is yyyy.mm.dd.,
phone_number: starts with a + sign, followed by the country code and the phone number,
email: standard email format,
first_project_date: format is yyyy.mm.dd.,
tech_stacks: languages separated by a |. Languages can be the following: Ruby,Javascript,PHP,Elixir,Phoenix,React,NodeJS,AngularJS,Ruby on Rails.

Assignments:

Convert to a list:

Create a module, which gets the string above containing the csv data in its constructor. Create a function, called get_subcontractors_as_a_list, which gives back the data converted to a list of lists. The function should also do the following before converting the csv to a list:

Converts the gender to an enum.
Converts birth_date and first_project_date to a date.
Tech_stack should be a list of enums.

Convert the list to a map:

Create a function, called get_subcontractors_as_a_map, which gives back the data converted to a list of maps. The function should do the conversions above but some more:

Every map should have a key called is_adult, which should be true if the subcontractor is older than 18 years and false if not.
Every map should have a key called has_a_gmail_account, which should be true if the email_address field ends with gmail.com.
Every map should have a key called phone_number_country, which should store the country based on the country code in a string (in case itâ€™s hard to solve for all country codes, select 10 country codes which gets recognised. In this case if the country code is not within the recognised countries, the phone_number_country should be empty.
Instead of giving back the full_name, the map should contain last_name, first_name, middle_name. middle_name should be empty, if the full name contains only 2 names.
